years after the protests, my friend M recommended this book to me. we were both in the front lines together and i poured cold water into her eyes when we got hit. we didn’t know what we were doing that day. Our bond had been forged in the art world—a space strangely disconnected from the unrest unfolding just beyond its walls. We, too, were disconnected. Both of us had gone schools overseas, spending time at home only in the summer. We spoke English to each other, despite being fluent in Cantonese. We called kids who didn’t attend international schools “locals,” as if we weren’t local ourselves, born and raised in Hong Kong. Still, there we were, standing in a crowd, trying to follow protest chants built on Cantonese slang we barely understood. Walking through the same neighborhoods where our english-speaking schools once took us on field trips to learn about “local culture.”
i role played as the local i thought i wasn’t. i absorbed everything around me within minutes. i held my thumb and pinky up for the allen key. my hands dug into the bricks. someone saw that my head was bare, and then i had a helmet and goggles. i held hands with someone who couldn’t see because they looked right where the police shot from.
 two weeks later i was back in new york, and every day i watched in silence. On Instagram, I saw friends posting stories of support—infographics, yellow umbrellas.  In the New York Times comment sections, I saw my classmate mocking the protestors. I only had M to talk to—everyone else refused to speak. Even then, there wasn’t much to say. People like us couldn’t do anything. Our hands and feet, our camaraderie, were tied. I saw the Lennon Wall outside my apartment near Union Square and cried in front of it, then told myself it was ridiculous and stopped. The wall lasted a week before all the messages of support were scraped off.

 what was there to miss? we were never going to win. M and I were born post-1997, with the embedded knowledge that our home had an expiration date. One that felt final and inevitable. For many like us—“non-locals” with options—that knowledge became a contingency plan: live your life elsewhere. I was  well-equipped for that. And it was easy not to miss anything when things changed so quickly. Streets physically changed every year. Shops and cafés appeared and disappeared within months. The home I grew up in is now 30 minutes farther away than it was before the new highway.

That tendency felt built-in. There was no vote, no military. Hong Kong was not sovereign. The environment was heavy—traditional Chinese hierarchy overlaid with British-style formality. It didn’t invite participation. It made more sense to leave.i picked up this book not because i knew there was a call to action waiting for me, or that it would offer any solutions or assurances about my confused state of grief post-protest, but because i just desperately wanted to read it. maybe, by reading the words, i would illuminate to myself the hidden core of what happened.
 Then I reached the part where the author mentioned her friend T. His name was unusual. I thought I might know him. He made music and got migraines from the tear gas outside his apartment. She described his childhood, his connection to the city, his unwillingness to leave, even though he said he would. He wrote songs about the movement. His accent matched what I remembered—shaped by English-language education in Hong Kong.
I realized I’d met him before. At the gallery, after the protests. He came in often. Not to buy anything, just to play music with the other artists who hung out there. he never said a word about what happened years before, nor would i have expected him to given the risk of being accused of secession.
 upon my realization i could not stop crying. i thought about saying something but what was there to say? After the government used the pandemic to let the movement fade out and criminalized even vague signs of disloyalty, the city fell silent. we may have held hands before but i could never know you. you protected me when i couldn’t have known you. i know we notice when we still see remnants of protest graffiti in some hidden subway corner. i know we see the concrete filling in the holes where bricks have been ripped out. i know why we don’t wear all black anymore. we know what we have seen together.
