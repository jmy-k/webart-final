in the past 5 months, we have been resorting to various methods and means to tackle this escalating violence.

when we try to apprehend any of these rioters, we have to achieve one purpose: quick and full control.

i believe that the great majority of hong kong people are law-abiding citizens. they love the country. they love hong kong. they want stability and prosperity.

violence is not going to give us any solution to the problems that hong kong is facing.

we will spare no effort in finding ways and means that could end the violence.

the police force is safeguarding hong kong's law and order, and ensuring hong kong's continued safety.
