<div class="pageTitle">about <i>Memory Garden</i></div>

<b>Memory Garden</b> is the brainchild of one individual driven by a singular vision: to give your digital life a permanent home. In a world where memories are often fleeting, we provide a space where your moments—photos, messages, experiences—are not just stored, but safeguarded.

With the founder's relentless drive to preserve the digital footprint of every individual, Memory Garden was created as an archive designed to outlast time itself.

It’s not a tool. It’s the eternal resting place for what matters most—<b>OUR</b> memories.
